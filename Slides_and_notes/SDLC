1) Planning:
        Project Initiation: Define the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the project. Identify key stakeholders and establish a project team.
        Requirement Analysis: Gather and document user requirements, system requirements, and functional specifications.
        Project Planning: Develop a project plan that includes schedules, resource allocation, budgets, and risk assessments.
        Feasibility Study: Evaluate the technical, operational, and financial feasibility of the project.

2) Design:
        System Design: Create high-level and low-level system designs based on the requirements. Define system architecture, data structures, interfaces, and algorithms.
        Database Design: Design the database schema, tables, relationships, and data storage strategies.
        User Interface (UI) Design: Create the user interface design, including layout, navigation, and user interaction.
        Detailed Design: Develop detailed design documents and diagrams, such as UML diagrams or flowcharts.

3) Implementation (Coding):
        Write and test the actual source code for the software based on the design specifications.
        Follow coding standards and best practices.
        Perform unit testing to ensure that individual components or modules work correctly.

4) Testing:
        Unit Testing: Test individual components or modules in isolation to verify their correctness.
        Integration Testing: Test the interaction and integration between various modules or components.
        System Testing: Test the entire software system to ensure it meets the requirements and functions as expected.
        User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Allow end-users or stakeholders to test the software to ensure it aligns with their needs and expectations.
        Regression Testing: Re-run tests to ensure that new changes or features do not introduce defects into previously working code.
        Performance Testing: Evaluate the software's performance under various conditions (e.g., load testing, stress testing).

5) Deployment:
        Prepare for the deployment of the software to the production environment.
        Create deployment packages and installation scripts.
        Perform user training and documentation.
        Execute the deployment plan and monitor the transition to the production environment.

6) Maintenance and Support:
        Provide ongoing support and maintenance to address defects, updates, and changes.
        Implement software enhancements and optimizations as needed.
        Monitor system performance and security.
        Periodically review and update documentation.

7) Closure:
        Formalize project closure by obtaining final approvals and sign-offs from stakeholders.
        Archive project documentation and code.
        Perform a project post-mortem to analyze what went well and what could be improved.
