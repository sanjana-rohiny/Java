Package
=======
Package in java as the name suggests is a pack(group) of
classes, interfaces and other packages.

Packages are used in Java 
	1- in order to prevent naming conflicts, 
	2- to control access of classes/interfaces etc
	
Package in java can be categorized in two form
        1. Built-in - Provided by Java, as a part of standard library
        	Eg, java.lang, java.util, java.io
        2. User define - created by Java developers to organize their own classes and code.

Defining user defined package
============================
To create a user-defined package, you typically define a package statement 
at the beginning of your source code file, indicating the package's name 

Eg,
Here two calsses with same name, Teacher.java is created in two packages
One for implementation of CBSE Teacher, and the other for ICSE Teacher.

Packages are defines as

package1:  give below statement at the  beginning of Teaher .java for CBSE 
		package college.staff.cbse;

package2:  give below statement at the  beginning of Teaher .java for ICSE
		package college.staff.icse;

Here "college.staff.icse" each "." (dot) identidies by a folder

That is, for "college.staff.icse" 
	The class "Teacher.java" will be inside folder "icse".
	"icse" folder will be inside folder "staff"
	"staff" folder will be inside "college".

Similarly
for "college.staff.cbse"
	The class "Teacher.java" will be inside folder "cbse".
	"cbse" folder will be inside folder "staff"
	"staff" folder will be inside folder "college".

How to use packages
===================
Ans: By "import" statement at the top of java file.

eg, 
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

import college.staff.cbse.*; // Import the CBSE Teacher class
import college.staff.icse.*; // Import the ICSE Teacher class 

import java.util.*;
".*" imports all the classes in the package "java.util" 

How to solve naming conflicts
=============================
Eg, we have two classes with same name "Teacher.java" 
and differnet implementation in two packages.

package 1 : college.staff.icse
         class Teacher.java
         
package 2 : college.staff.cbse
         class Teacher.java

If one Test program uses this, there will be conflict
to identify, which class of which package, as class name is same  (Teacher)

Soln:
qualify class with package name as below

1- for ICSE Teacher class
	college.staff.icse.Teacher icseTeacher = 
        	new college.staff.icse.Teacher("Alice", "Science", "Biology")
        	
 
1- for CBSE Teacher class
	college.staff.cbse.Teacher cbseTeacher = 
        	new college.staff.cbse.Teacher("Bob", "Math", 10);
 
Compiling classes in package
============================
Folder structure program1/college/staff/icse/

program1$ javac college/staff/icse/Teacher.java

-> Teacher.class will be created inside college/staff/icse folder

Running classes package
=======================
program1$ java college.staff.icse.Teacher
