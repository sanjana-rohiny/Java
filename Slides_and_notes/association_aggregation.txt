Association 
-there is NO strong ownership
-In a simple association between a Library class and a Book class, the library is associated with books, but it doesn't create or manage individual books. Books can exist independently, and changes in the library (e.g., adding or removing a book) do not imply strong ownership.

Aggregation
-there is STROG ownership
In an aggregation relationship between a Car class (whole) and a Wheel class (part), the Car class may create, configure, and manage instances of Wheel. It relies on the existence of wheels to function as a car. This is an example of strong ownership.


The relationship between a "Hospital" and a "Doctor" can typically be represented as an association rather than aggregation, as it usually doesn't imply a strong whole-part relationship or ownership. Here's why it's usually considered an association:
